c programing language
    history
        =>c language was intr in 1970's (1972)
        =>Dennis ritchie
        =>AT&T laboratories

    =>c language developed to overcome the problem in old programing language
        =>first programing language before c, B language,A language
        =>c language was developed to build linex os  (UNIX)
        =>all kernal software writen on c language

        mkdir
        cd 

    =>1957 =>telephone

    =>1960 language Algol

    =>1970 BCL(BCPL)
    =>B 1970 =>tv there remote
    =>1970's  =>operating system interaction
        =>c language 1972
        =>1975

        =>1999 stnd language build software

    =>c is an mother of language
        what modern language java, python,javascript,
        most of language compiler,jvm,kernels written by c language
        c is core language for all the language
        =>compiler of your language

    =>c mid level language
        =>becouse c support both the concept low-level language and high-level

        high level ===>c compiler ====> low level ===>machine code ===>that was used by kernels to execute your h/want
    
    => c is an system language
        =>c is basicaly help us to build a software to intract with h/w
            =>(ex kernel)
        =>os,drivers


features of c language
    =>faster language
    =>mid-level language
    =>simple language
    =>portable
        =>c language i can use in different operating system
        =>windows,unix,mac
    =>pointers
    =>library
    =>it will support for high level
    =>good memory managment
    =>structre approch
        


c programing language 
    =>in our local system if you want execute c program we need compiler
    =>codeBlocks
    =>turbo c
        =>c virtual env

procedure of c language
    =>you have start with c headrs
    =>declaration of all the function that used in file need to mention
    =>mention all variable in our program
    =>main method


compilation in c
    =>what is compilation?
        =>convert our code into binary
        =>convert source code into object code

    when we written any code in c that will be in the formate of developer understanding level


    printf("my name is surya") 

    but our system will understanding only one language called binary

    main(){
        printf("my name is surya")   ========>   00111111111111111000000000000
                                                00000000000001010010001000100100 ==========>is send to executor(cpu)=====>then h/w start work on you task
                                                11001001000100100100101000000
    }
     process the main code =====>compilation(compiler)=====>machine code==========>linking process(execution pocess)=======>output

    for do compilation process we need a compiler
    here compiler is software which help us to conveert you main code to machine



variables in c
        =>variable will be name of memory location where the data is stored
    
    varible in c why we need variable
        =>in our program we try to focus on build logic of application
        =>we mainly consider handling of how to handle the data efficiently

    =>shop managment system
        =>customer
        =>product
        =>shopping customer detials
        =>arragment of product

        =>h/want
        =>access of data from h/w will be diffecult

    =>variable will help us to hold the data temp in RAM at that time
    =>variable is very importat feature of any programing this will help us to hold the data in such a way that when i need that data i can access with in my program with the help of that variable

    syntax of variable 
        =>datatype variable_name;
        =>two types we can create variable
        =>we can just declaration the variable
                datatype variable_name; =>declaration

        =>we can define the varible
                datatype variable_name = value; defination

    when we create any variables
        we can multiple variable of same type a time

        datatype variable_name,variable_name2,variable_name3;

        ex float num1,num2,num3;

    when we declare any variable name
            we have to follow some rule

            1)all the variable name must be start with alphabets,underscore
            2)all can have alphabets,number,underscore
            3)we con't reserved word or keyword


    ex  
        check valid varable or not

            float per%; invalid
            float __score; valid
            float score35,int;

        =>we have follow varible declaration rule
            =>when we try to create any variable
                =>allways your name must be start will small letter
                =>if there will to words in variable second word as to be start with capital letter

            string fullFirstName;

        

        type of variable in c
            =>this type of variable is divided based on it's use
                =>local variable
                    =>any variable you beclare with in the block of the code,that will be local (block can be method,structure,condition)
                    =>block is nothing but anything that start with { end with } that is called block\
                    =>the scope of that variable will be with in that block
                =>global variable
                    =>a variable which is declared out the code block(function) that variable are called global variable
                    =>global variable we can access any where in our program=>scope will be though our program
                =>static variable 
                static variable is also an normal variable
                static variable will same in entire program life address
                syntax 

                static datatype variable;

datatype in c
            =>basic type primitive data type
                data type       size
                =>char           1 byte
                    char demo='h';
                    array char to hold multiple char
                =>int            2 byte
                    whole number 
                    int age=30;
                =>short          1 byte
                    short age=5;
                =>long int       4 byte
                    long int phno=5557834563453452364;

                =>float        2 byte - 4 byte
                    float per=30.856564;       
                =>double      4 byte -8 byte    
                        double per = 40.5365625464563;
                =>long double   10byte;
                 long double pi=3.1456732198
            =>Derived data type
                =>a data type which is created with the help of primitive data
                ex : array

                int array[10];
                string 
            =>structre date type

                    =>if you combine different data type together as single datatype

formate of datatype
    =>when we want to hndle data type in c (taking input/print the value ) we need of that data
    datatype   formate
    char        %c
    SHORT       %s
    int         %d
    long int    %ld
    float       %f
    double      %b




c programing operator
    what is operator?
        =>operator is symbol(they have some logic) used to perform operation on operands(value,variable)
            =>if you need to some usefull task on data we can do that with help of operator 
    =>Arithmetic 
        =>if you want perform any Arithmetic operation we need Arithmetic
            =>add(+),sub(-),mul(*),div(/)
            ,mod(%)=>when you divid any number if you don't want to divide with decimal ,it return the remaining value in division

    =>logical 
        =>&&(and),||(or),!(not)
        this will cosider boolean value (true,false)
    ex  
        we use logical operator to combine multiple condition

        age>18 age<30

        age>18 && age<30
            print("he can go to the college")

        logic and
                return true =>if both condtion id true

                true && true =>true
                false =>false

        logical or
                true || false =>true
                false || true =>true
                false || false =>false
        logical not !
                true =>!true=>false
                !false =>true
    =>relational
        it will help us compare the operands
            <,>,<=,>=,==,!=

        car_cost<1000000
            printf("you can get this car")
        age==18
         pintf("you can vote from this year")
    =>bitwise
        =>&,|,!
            =>it checks bit by bit
            =>doing binary calculation

            2&4    =>   
            2     =>  0010
            4     =>  0100
            2&4   =>  0000

        10&2 ==>  2,
                
            10=>  1010
            2 =>   0010
            =>     0010 =>2
   =>assignment
        =>we want to asign any value to variable we need assignment       
        = is an assignment shorthand operator
        shorthand is a combination of assignment operands and Arithmetic
            => = 
            shorthand
                => +=
                =>-=
                =>*=
                =>/=
                =>%=

    =>shift operator
        => right shift
            >>
        => left shift
           <<
        shift operator also perform on bit wise

        10>>2 => 00001010 => 00000101 => 00000010

    =>unary
        =>++ --
        =>prefix
        int age=30;
        ++age;
        =>postfix 
        age++

condition statments

    =>if you want to controll the execution of code we need conditional statments
    =>if-else
    =>switch
    =>loop
    =>jump statments

    if()
        =>condition statments
            =>it will execution the block of next to it if and only if the condition is true
    
    each if condition have there own block
    syntax
    if(condition){ //if this block false
        statments;
        ...
        ..
    }
    else{
            statments ..
            that will be executed;
    }

    //different type of if else condtion 

        =>simple if and else condition
        =>nested if else condition
        =>if else lader
        if(){

        }
        else if(){

        }
        else if(){

        }
        else{

        }

        task
            take a input from user the input is age
            int age
            scanf("%d",&age);

            you have check if range of age 
            (6-12)
            {
                person in pri scholl
            }

            {
                is a kid
            }

switch
 in c
    =>switch
        case
        break
        default

        when we have multiple choice ,when we need to select with in that choice we switch statments

        syntax

        switch(expression){
            case choice1: statments
                break;
            case choice2: statments

            default:
                it will help us to execute this if choice willnot match ny case;
        }

        loop statments
            =>check a condition multiple time
            =>execute the perticular block multiple time we loop until it reach specific condition

        =>reusability of statments
        =>it will help us repeatedly execute same statments multiple based on condition

        in c we have different types of looping statments
        1)for loop
            =>the for syntax
            for(intial value;condition;increment stat){
                statments;
            }

        
        2)while loop
        3)do while
